Onboarding Flow: Step-by-Step vs. Single-Screen Overview
US4 – User Onboarding Experience

Happiness: User satisfaction score after onboarding (via in-app feedback prompt).
Engagement: Time spent completing onboarding.
Adoption: Percentage of users who finish onboarding and proceed to the main app dashboard.
Retention: Percentage of users who return within 3 days after first login.
Task Success: Completion rate of onboarding steps.
 
What problem are we trying to solve?
New users are dropping off before completing the onboarding process. Analytics show that many users exit after the first or second onboarding screen, suggesting that the multi step design feels long or repetitive. This prevents them from reaching the main app experience, which delays or completely stops engagement with key features.

Hypothesis
If the onboarding process is redesigned into a single, scrollable page that summarizes all setup steps (instead of multiple separate screens), users will find it easier and faster to complete, leading to:
Higher onboarding completion rates, Increased first-session engagement, Improved short-term retention.

Experiment Setup (Using Firebase):
Audience: 50% of new users (randomly assigned).
Experiment Allocation:
Group A (Control): Default multi-step onboarding flow (current design).
Group B (Variant): Single-screen scrollable onboarding showing all steps in one page.

Variations:
### Variation A (Control): Multi-Step Flow
4 separate screens: Welcome → Permissions → Personalization → Confirmation
“Next” button at the bottom of each screen
Progress bar showing step number

### Variation B (Test): Single-Screen Overview
All steps condensed into one scrollable screen
Each section collapsible/expandable for clarity
“Start Using App” button at the bottom
