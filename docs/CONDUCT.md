# 305Soft Team Code of Conduct
### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of 305Soft pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others

* Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences

* Accepting feedback gracefully

* Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them

* Prioritizing the success of the team over individual preferences

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal attacks

* Public or private harassment

* Publishing private information (such as emails or phone numbers) without consent

* Other unprofessional or disruptive conduct

### Enforcement Responsibilities

* Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of behavior and will take appropriate action when violations occur. They have the right to remove or reject comments, commits, code, or contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including team meetings, online communication, and official representation of the group.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the SCRUM Master github user: "ekambeer-grewal", or to URIcsc305@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and handled promptly, respectfully, and confidentially.

## 305Soft Team Policies
### No Distracted Use of Technology

All team members agree to refrain from using phones or unrelated devices during meetings or collaborative work sessions. Laptops should be used only for project-related tasks.

### Decision-Making

Decisions will be made by majority vote whenever possible. If a decision affects all members significantly, we will aim for consensus through discussion before voting.

### Attendance

Members are expected to attend all scheduled team meetings unless excused for valid reasons such as illness, class conflicts, or emergencies.
If a meeting is missed, the member must review meeting notes and reach out to the notetaker for updates within 24 hours.

### Assignments

Tasks will be divided during meetings based on each member’s strengths and interests.
Members who fail to complete tasks on time will be given a reminder and asked to communicate any blockers. Continued neglect of assignments will result in a team discussion with possible reassignment of responsibilities.

### Participation and Communication

Team communication will occur primarily through Discord and GitHub Issues.
All members are encouraged to participate actively, ask questions, and offer help when needed.
We value everyone’s input equally and will rotate speaking order when necessary to ensure fairness.

### Meeting Times and Mediums

Meeting times will be chosen based on all members’ availability using a shared calendar. Meetings will occur in person or on Zoom as agreed by the team.

### Agenda, Minutes, and Notes

A meeting facilitator will prepare an agenda before each meeting.
A designated notetaker (rotating role) will summarize key decisions and post notes in a shared Google Doc or the /docs/ folder on GitHub within 24 hours.

### Promptness

Members are expected to join meetings on time.
Being more than 5 minutes late without notice counts as a tardy. Repeated lateness will be addressed privately by the team lead.

### Conversational Courtesies

All members will:

* Listen actively and avoid interrupting

* Encourage quieter members to share opinions

* Avoid dominating discussions or going off-topic

* Use respectful, professional language at all times

### Enforcement and Feedback

The team will first use constructive feedback and private discussion to resolve minor issues.
If conflicts persist, the issue will be raised to the course instructor or TA.
Feedback will be given respectfully—preferably in private—and received with openness to improvement.
